With so much dollar demand, the rupee\u2019s getting squeezed.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Global Uncertainty is Crushing Us\n\nGeopolitical tensions (Ukraine, anyone?) have investors running to \u2018safe\u2019 currencies like the US dollar, leaving the rupee to drop. \ud83c\udf0d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Crude Oil Prices are Sky-High\n\nIndia imports over 80% of its crude oil, and with oil still hovering above $100 per barrel, our import bills are spiking. \ud83d\udee2\ufe0f\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Inflation is Eating Away at Us\n\nWith the rupee falling, imported goods are getting pricier. You\u2019ve probably already noticed your monthly budget taking a hit. \ud83d\uded2\n\nSo, how does this affect us (people in India)?\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Higher Cost of Living\n\nExpect prices for fuel, groceries, and everyday goods to climb. It\u2019s already happening, and it\u2019s not slowing down.\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Studying Abroad? \n\nGet Ready for a Price Hike\nWith a weaker rupee, foreign education is getting even more expensive. \n\nYour dream of sending your kids abroad just got costlier.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Businesses Are Under Pressure\n\nCompanies that rely on imports or have foreign loans are feeling the heat, and this could slow down growth across industries.\n\nRising living costs are hitting hard, and we need some serious action. \n\nWill the government step in with reforms to stabilize the rupee?\n\nWhat do YOU think India\u2019s next move should be to tackle this crisis? \n\nLet\u2019s discuss \ud83d\udc47",

Global powerhouses, local impact:\n\nCombined, they\u2019ve got millions of subscribers worldwide, with India as their top viewer base.\n\nFun fact: 30% of YouTube\u2019s viewership comes from India\u2014which makes this launch a no-brainer for these creators.\n\n2. Massive valuations and revenue numbers:\n\nMrBeast\u2019s Feastables already racks up millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nPrime, Logan\u2019s hydration drink, has a valuation over $3-5 billion dollars \n\nBy tapping into their massive Indian following, they\u2019re set to grow even bigger \ud83d\udcc8\n\n3. Perfect timing for new markets:\n\nUnlike the U.S., India\u2019s energy drink and premium chocolate markets are still relatively untapped.\n\nPrime and Feastables are already available on Amazon and Blinkit for around 500 rupees\u2014a 10x markup!\n\nOnce these products hit at regular prices, think 50-100 rupees, they\u2019re bound to sell like hot cakes.\n\n4. Impact on India\u2019s creator economy:\n\nBy bringing their brands to India, they\u2019re not just selling products; they\u2019re paving the way for Indian creators to monetize like never before.\n\nIf this model works, expect more global creator brands to start making India a priority market.\n\nWith Feastables and Prime on the ground, the era of creators building billion-dollar brands in India might just be beginning. \ud83d\ude80\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nCould this change the future of creator-led brands in India? \n\nWould you try Prime and Feastables once they launch in India?\n\nLet me know in comment also do reshare if you enjoyed read it \ud83d\ude4f",

A culture of innovation and the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people from around the world.\n\n3. Private space to work distraction-free, with freedom over your personal choices.\n\n4. Better civic sense, law, and order.\n\n5. Financial benefit\u2014especially when visiting India, where the exchange rate multiplies your money by 80.\n\nCONS\n\n1. Visa issues create constant stress. It took 14 years for me to get my green card due to the backlog for India.\n\n2. Poor food quality. Vegetables and other ingredients lack their original taste. Eating stale, frozen food is common.\n\n3. Social isolation, which can be stressful, especially during sickness or challenges.\n\n4. Lack of thrill. Life feels predictable, like a for-loop: Weekdays\u2014work, kids' classes, walk, sleep. Weekends\u2014Costco/Patel brother visits, cleaning, birthday parties, temple visits. While this may be true in India as well, in the USA it is extreme\n\n5. No concept of bai (maid). You are your own Ramukaka and Shantabai \n\nUltimately, happiness is very subjective.
