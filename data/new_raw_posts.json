Here is how it affects you and me 👇\n\nTo start with, let's understand why it's happening.\n\n1️⃣ Foreign Investors are Fleeing\n\nThis year alone, $28.4 billion has been pulled out from Indian markets. With so much dollar demand, the rupee’s getting squeezed.\n\n2️⃣ Global Uncertainty is Crushing Us\n\nGeopolitical tensions (Ukraine, anyone?) have investors running to ‘safe’ currencies like the US dollar, leaving the rupee to drop. 🌍\n\n3️⃣ Crude Oil Prices are Sky-High\n\nIndia imports over 80% of its crude oil, and with oil still hovering above $100 per barrel, our import bills are spiking. 🛢️\n\n4️⃣ Inflation is Eating Away at Us\n\nWith the rupee falling, imported goods are getting pricier. You’ve probably already noticed your monthly budget taking a hit. 🛒\n\nSo, how does this affect us (people in India)?\n\n💸 Higher Cost of Living\n\nExpect prices for fuel, groceries, and everyday goods to climb. It’s already happening, and it’s not slowing down.\n\n🎓 Studying Abroad? \n\nGet Ready for a Price Hike\nWith a weaker rupee, foreign education is getting even more expensive. \n\nYour dream of sending your kids abroad just got costlier.\n\n📉 Businesses Are Under Pressure\n\nCompanies that rely on imports or have foreign loans are feeling the heat, and this could slow down growth across industries.\n\nRising living costs are hitting hard, and we need some serious action. \n\nWill the government step in with reforms to stabilize the rupee?\n\nWhat do YOU think India’s next move should be to tackle this crisis? \n\nLet’s discuss 👇",

        "text": "MrBeast and Logan Paul are in India to launch Feastables and Prime drink 🔥\n\nIt's going to be game changer, here is why 👇\n\n1. Global powerhouses, local impact:\n\nCombined, they’ve got millions of subscribers worldwide, with India as their top viewer base.\n\nFun fact: 30% of YouTube’s viewership comes from India—which makes this launch a no-brainer for these creators.\n\n2. Massive valuations and revenue numbers:\n\nMrBeast’s Feastables already racks up millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nPrime, Logan’s hydration drink, has a valuation over $3-5 billion dollars \n\nBy tapping into their massive Indian following, they’re set to grow even bigger 📈\n\n3. Perfect timing for new markets:\n\nUnlike the U.S., India’s energy drink and premium chocolate markets are still relatively untapped.\n\nPrime and Feastables are already available on Amazon and Blinkit for around 500 rupees—a 10x markup!\n\nOnce these products hit at regular prices, think 50-100 rupees, they’re bound to sell like hot cakes.\n\n4. Impact on India’s creator economy:\n\nBy bringing their brands to India, they’re not just selling products; they’re paving the way for Indian creators to monetize like never before.\n\nIf this model works, expect more global creator brands to start making India a priority market.\n\nWith Feastables and Prime on the ground, the era of creators building billion-dollar brands in India might just be beginning. 🚀\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nCould this change the future of creator-led brands in India? \n\nWould you try Prime and Feastables once they launch in India?\n\nLet me know in comment also do reshare if you enjoyed read it 🙏",

        "text": "5,000 employees of Swiggy to make 8000 crores 🤯\n\nHere is how\n\nYou all know that Swiggy is going public but this isn’t just another IPO. \n\nIt’s a game-changer for employee wealth in India’s startup scene. \n\nSwiggy has designed its ESOP policy to be one of the most lucrative and inclusive out there—and here’s why it’s blowing minds across the industry.\n\nYou see, Swiggy’s ESOP structure has a unique feature that’s hard to find in other companies: it includes everyone. \n\nThere’s a structured model for distributing ESOPs, meaning employees across levels and even former employees keep their vested shares. \n\nAt one point in 2019, Swiggy employed over 12,000 people. \n\nToday, that number is down to about 5,500, but even those who have moved on still retain their vested options. \n\nCompare that to most startups, where only a select few receive stock options, and this becomes truly rare.\n\nBut it’s not just about access. \n\nThe terms are equally enticing. \n\nUnlike competitors like Zomato that back-load vesting over four years, Swiggy’s ESOPs vest evenly, giving employees 25% each year. \n\nThis way, every year counts—and so does every employee’s commitment.\n\nWhy does this matter so much now? \n\nSwiggy’s IPO is about to be one of India’s biggest wealth events for employees.\n\nWith close to 230 million ESOPs, valued at over ₹8,960 crore ($1.06 billion), \nthousands of employees are on the brink of life-changing gains. \n\nAnd here’s a twist: \n\nSwiggy secured a rare exemption from SEBI to allow employees to sell shares just one month after the IPO, creating instant liquidity. \n\nPeople are already talking about how they’ll invest their new wealth—from launching startups and paying off student loans to buying real estate in Bangalore.\n\nFor a startup community used to high turnover, \n\nSwiggy’s focus on employees goes deep. \n\nFounder Harsha Majety made it a priority early on. \n\nHiring Girish Menon as CHRO in 2016 was a turning point—he came with experience from Flipkart and HSBC, and since then, \n\nSwiggy has built a people-first approach to growth. \n\nEven as the company faced cuts and tightened its budget to boost profitability, it kept the team’s long-term wealth in mind. \n\nIt’s a move that’s lowered Swiggy’s wage bill from 18% of total expenses in 2022 to 14% in 2024, a critical step as it approaches public markets.\n\nSo, are we witnessing a new era of employee wealth creation in India’s startup landscape? \n\nOr is Swiggy just an outlier in a sea of more selective ESOP policies?\n\nLet’s dive into it—would love to hear your thoughts! 👇\n\nCredits to: The Arc for the detailed research ( Link in comments )",

A culture of innovation and the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people from around the world.\n\n3. Private space to work distraction-free, with freedom over your personal choices.\n\n4. Better civic sense, law, and order.\n\n5. Financial benefit—especially when visiting India, where the exchange rate multiplies your money by 80.\n\nCONS\n\n1. Visa issues create constant stress. It took 14 years for me to get my green card due to the backlog for India.\n\n2. Poor food quality. Vegetables and other ingredients lack their original taste. Eating stale, frozen food is common.\n\n3. Social isolation, which can be stressful, especially during sickness or challenges.\n\n4. Lack of thrill. Life feels predictable, like a for-loop: Weekdays—work, kids' classes, walk, sleep. Weekends—Costco/Patel brother visits, cleaning, birthday parties, temple visits. While this may be true in India as well, in the USA it is extreme\n\n5. No concept of bai (maid). You are your own Ramukaka and Shantabai \n\nUltimately, happiness is very subjective. It depends on your personality, goals, and experiences. Some people are happy and content, while others regret not moving back.\n\nHow has your experience in the USA been so far?",
